# Mycodo 

## Environmental Regulation System

### Latest version: 4.1.0 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kizniche/Mycodo.svg?branch=mycodo_dev)](https://travis-ci.org/kizniche/Mycodo) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5b9c21d5680f4f7fb87df1cf32f71e80?branch=mycodo_dev)](https://www.codacy.com/app/kyletgabriel/Mycodo?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=kizniche/Mycodo&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Mycodo is a remote monitoring and automated regulation system with a focus on modulating environmental conditions. It was built to run on the Raspberry Pi (versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3) and aims to be easy to install and set up.

The core system coordinates a diverse set of responses to sensor measurements, including actions such as camera captures, email notifications, relay activation/deactivation, regulation with PID control, and more. Mycodo has been used for cultivating gourmet mushrooms, cultivating plants, culturing microorganisms, maintaining honey bee apiary homeostasis, incubating snake eggs and young animals, aging cheeses, fermenting foods, maintaining aquatic systems, and more.



## What is PID Control?

[![Mycodo](http://kylegabriel.com/projects/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/Mycodo-3.6.0-tango-Graph-2016-05-21-11-15-26.png)](http://kylegabriel.com/projects/)

A [proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little oscillation.

In the top graph of the above screenshot visualizes the regulation of temperature in a sealed chamber. The red line is the desired temperature setpoint that has been configured (which also happens to have been configured to change over the course of each day). The blue line is the actual recorded temperature. The green vertical bars represent how long a heater is activated for, per every 20-second period. This regulation was achieved with minimal tuning (Actual tuned gains: K<sub>P</sub>=0.08, K<sub>I</sub>=0.005, K<sub>D</sub>=0.001), and already displays a very minimal deviation from the setpoint (±0.5° Celsius). Further tuning would reduce this variability even more.

## Install

These install procedures have been tested to work with a Raspberry Pi following a fresh install of [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (Full or Lite version), with an active internet connection.

Set up the initial settings with raspi-config. **It's very important that you don't skip the file system expansion and reboot! This needs to be done before continuing or there won't be any free disk space.**

```sudo raspi-config```

 + Expand File system (required)**
 + Change User Password
 + Internationalisation Options -> Change Locale (set and select en_US.UTF-8 if US)
 + Internationalisation Options -> Change Timezone
 + Enable Camera
 + Advanced Options -> Enable I<sup>2</sup>C (required if using certain sensors)
 + **Reboot (required)**


Mycodo will be installed by executing setup.sh. As a part of the installation, it will install and modify the default apache2 configuration to host the Mycodo web UI. If you require a custom setup, examine and modify this script accordingly. If you do not require a custom setup, just run the install script with the following commands:

```
cd ~
wget -O mycodo-latest.tar.gz https://api.github.com/repos/kizniche/mycodo/tarball
mkdir Mycodo
tar xzf mycodo-latest.tar.gz -C Mycodo --strip-components=1
rm -f mycodo-latest.tar.gz
cd Mycodo/install
sudo /bin/bash ./setup.sh
```

Make sure the setup.sh script finishes without errors. A log of the setup.sh script output will be created at ~/Mycodo/install/setup.log.

If the install is successful, the web user interface should be accessible with your PI's IP address https://IPaddress/. The first time you visit this page, you will be prompted to create an admin user. Alternatively, an admin user may also be created with the following command:

```sudo ~/Mycodo/init_databases.py --addadmin```

That's it. You should be redirected to the login page to use the credentials just created to log in. Once logged in, make sure the host name and version number at the top left is green, indicating the daemon is running. Red indicates the daemon is inactive or unresponsive. Ensure any java-blocking plugins are disabled for all the web UI features to work.


## Install Notes

If you want write access to the mycodo files, add your user to the mycodo group, changing 'username' to your user.

```sudo usermod -a -G mycodo username```

In certain circumstances after the initial install, the mycodo service will not be able to start because of a missing or corrupt package. I'm still trying to understand why this happens and how to prevent it. If you cannot start the daemon, try to reinstall the required modules with the following command:

```sudo pip install -r ~/Mycodo/install/requirements.txt --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-deps```

Then reboot

```sudo shutdown now -r```

If you receive an unresolvable error during the install, please [create an issue](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues).



## Supported Devices and Sensors

Certain sensors will require extra steps to be taken in order to set up the interface for communication. This includes I<sup>2</sup>C, one-wire, and UART.

### 1-Wire

The 1-wire interface should be configured with [these instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing).

> [DS18B20](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf) Temperature

### GPIO

> [DHT11, DHT22, AM2302](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/wiring) Relative humidity and temperature.

> [SHT1x, SHT2x, SHT7x](https://github.com/mk-fg/sht-sensor) Relative humidity and temperature.

### UART

> [K30](http://www.co2meter.com/products/k-30-co2-sensor-module) Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in ppmv

[This documentation](http://www.co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN137-Raspberry-Pi.zip) provides specific installation procedures for the K30 with the Raspberry Pi version 1 or 2. Once the K30 has been configured with this documentation, it can be tested whether the sensor is able to be read, by executing ~/Mycodo/mycodo/tests/test_uart_K30.py

Because the UART is handled differently by the Raspberry Pi 3, from of the addition of bluetooth, there are a different set of instructions for getting the K30 working on the Raspberry Pi 3. If installing on a Raspberry Pi 3, you only need to perform these steps to get the K30 working:

Run raspi-config

```sudo raspi-config```

Go to Advanced Options->Serial and disable. Then edit /boot/config.txt

```sudo vi /boot/config.txt```

Find the line "enable_uart=0" and change it to "enable_uart=1", then reboot.

### I<sup>2</sup>C

The I<sup>2</sup>C interface should be enabled with `raspi-config`.

> [AM2315](https://github.com/lexruee/tentacle_pi) Relative humidity and temperature.

> [Atlas Scientific PT-1000](http://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/kits/temp_kit.html) Temperature

> [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bme280) Barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature

> [BMP085, BMP180](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-bmp085-with-raspberry-pi) Barometric pressure and temperature

> [HTU21D](http://www.te.com/usa-en/product-CAT-HSC0004.html) Relative humidity and temperature

> [TMP006, TMP007](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11859) Contactless temperature

> [TSL2561](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12055) Light

> [Chirp](https://wemakethings.net/chirp/) Moisture, light, and temperature

### Edge Detection

The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both, actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect sensors, float switches, and more.


### Devices

### I<sup>2</sup>C Multiplexers

All devices that connected to the Raspberry Pi by the I<sup>2</sup>C bus need to have a unique address in order to communicate. Some sensors may have the same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to change the address, however the address range may be limited, which limits by how many you can use at the same time. I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexers are extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow multiple sensors with the same I<sup>2</sup>C address to be connected.

> [TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C Multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/overview) (I<sup>2</sup>C): Has 8 selectable addresses, so 8 multiplexers can be connected to one Raspberry Pi. Each multiplexer has 8 channels, allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with the same address to be connected to each. 8 multiplexers x 8 channels = 64 devices/sensors with the same address.

> [TCA9545A Grove I<sup>2</sup>C Bus Multiplexer](http://store.switchdoc.com/i2c-4-channel-mux-extender-expander-board-grove-pin-headers-for-arduino-and-raspberry-pi/) (I<sup>2</sup>C): This board works a little differently than the TCA9548A, ablove. This board actually creates new 4 new I<sup>2</sup>C busses, each with their own selectable voltage, either 3.3 or 5.0 volts. Instructions to enable the Device Tree Overlay are at [https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a](https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a). Nothing else needs to be done in Mycodo after that except to select the correct I<sup>2</sup>C bus when configuring the sensor.

### Analog to Digital Converters

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor that outputs a variable voltage. The detectable voltage range of this ADC is &plusmn;2.048 volts. A [voltage divider](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers) may be necessary to attain this range.

> [ADS1x15 Analog to Digital Converters](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

> [MCP342x Analog to Digital Converters](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/MCP3424_18-Bit_ADC-4_Channel_with_Programmable_Gain_Amplifier_(SKU:DFR0316)) (I<sup>2</sup>C)



## Notes

A minimal set of anonymous usage statistics are collected to help improve development. No identifying information is saved from the information that is collected and it is only used to improve Mycodo. No other sources will have access to this information. The data collected is mainly how much specific features are used, how often errors occur, and other similar statistics. The data that's collected can be viewed from the 'View collected statistics' link in the Settings/General panel of the UI or in the file Mycodo/databases/statistics.csv. You may opt out from transmitting this information from the General settings in the Admin panel.

Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper is a binary executable used to update the system from the web interface. It has the setuid bit to permit it to be executed as root ('sudo update_mycodo.sh initialize' sets the correct permissions and setuid). Since shell scripts cannot be setuid (ony binary files), the mycodo_wrapper binary permits these operations to be executed as root by a non-root user (in this case, members of the group 'mycodo'). You can audit the source code of Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper.c and if you want to ensure the binary is indeed compiled from that source, you may compile it yourself with the following command. Otherwise, the compiled binary is already included and no further action is needed.

```sudo gcc ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper.c -o ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper```


### HTTP Server Security

SSL certificates will be generated and stored at ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_flask/ssl_certs/ during the install process. If you want to use your own SSL certificates, replace them as they are named in this directory. [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org) provides free verified SSL certificates.

If using the auto-generated certificate, be aware that they will not be verified when visiting the https:// version of the WEB UI. You will receive warning messages about the security of your site unless you add the certificate to your browser's trusted list. 


### Daemon info

The status of the daemon's service can be checked

```sudo service mycodo service```

The daemon can also be started manually if the systemd method above isn't used or an error needs to be debugged

```sudo ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py```

Also, use '-d' to log all debug messages to /var/log/mycodo/mycodo.log

```sudo ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py -d```


### Upgrading

If you already have Mycodo installed (>=4.0.0), you can perform an upgrade to the latest version on github by either using the Admin/Upgrade menu in the web UI (recommended) or by issuing the following command at the terminal. A log of the upgrade process is created at /var/log/mycodo/mycodoupgrade.log

```sudo ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_mycodo_release.sh upgrade```

Upgrading the mycodo database is performed automatically during the upgrade process, however it can also be performed manually with the following commands (Note: This does not create the database, only upgrade them. You must already have a database created in order to upgrade):

```bash
cd ~/Mycodo/databases
alembic upgrade head
```

Refer to the [alembic documentation](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) for other functions.



### Backup and Restore

Currently only the Mycodo settings are backed up when the system is upgraded from the Admin/Upgrade menu of the web UI.

If you would like to create a full backup that includes all the sensor data, which can be used to set up Mycodo on a new system as it was on the old, you can follow these steps:

Backup the influx databases:

```bash
influxd backup <path-to-metastore-backup>
influxd backup -database mycodo_db <path-to-database-backup>
```
 
Backup the Mycodo databases:

```bash
cd ~/Mycodo/databases
tar zcf ~/Mycodo-databases.tar.gz users.db mycodo.db
```

Then, on the new system, assign the same IP as the old system (if using the remote admin).

Clone the latest Mycodo from github (ensure [prerequisites](#install-notes) are taken care of first):

```bash
cd ~
clone git clone https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo
```

Extract the Mycodo databases back to Mycodo/databases:

```bash
tar zxvf ~/Mycodo-databases.tar.gz -C ~/Mycodo/databases
```

To ensure your databases are up-to-date and compatible with the latest version of Mycodo, run:

```bash
cd ~/Mycodo/databases
alembic upgrade head
```

Execute the Mycodo setup.sh script:

```bash
cd ~/Mycodo/install
sudo /bin/bash setup.sh
```

Restore the influx databases:

```bash
service influxdb stop
influxd restore -metadir /var/lib/influxdb/meta <path-to-metastore-backup>
influxd restore -datadir /var/lib/influxdb/data <path-to-database-backup>
sudo chown -R influxdb:influxdb /var/lib/influxdb
service influxdb start
```

The order of these events are important, because databases will be created and services started while the setup.sh script is running, so certain commands need to be done before this happens.

You could also copy the influx databases and just copy the entire Mycodo directory (archive to preserve permissions) to a new system, but I was going from the perspective of backing up the most minimal set of data, so if a system became corrupt somewhere, the backups could be restored to a new system.



### Translations

Translation support has been added but there is currently a lack of translations. If you know another language and would like to create translations, follow the steps below.

To create your own translation, use the following commands.

```cd ~/Mycodo/mycodo```

Create a messages.pot file from searching all files that contain translatable text.

```pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k lazy_gettext -o messages.pot .```

Create the translation for the new language (in this case it is 'es' for Spanish).

```pybabel init -i messages.pot -d mycodo_flask/translations -l es```

There will now be the file 'messages.po' created in ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_flask/translations/es/LC_MESSAGES/

Edit messages.po (I used [poedit](https://poedit.net/)) to edit and save the translation for each translatable word or phrase.

Finally, compile the new translation.

```pybabel compile -d mycodo_flask/translations```

If you would like to rescan for translatable text and update your language's messages.po file without losing your previous translation work, use the following commands instead of the above commands. Then edit with poedit and compile for it to take effect.

```
pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k lazy_gettext -o messages.pot .
pybabel update -i messages.pot -d mycodo_flask/translations
pybabel compile -d mycodo_flask/translations
```

Refer to [The Flask Mega-Tutorial, Part XIV: I18n and L10n](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xiv-i18n-and-l10n) for more details of this process.
