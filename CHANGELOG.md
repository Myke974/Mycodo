## 4.1.0 (Unreleased)

This release introduces a new method for upgrading Mycodo to the latest version. Upgrades will now be performed from github releases instead of commits, which should prevent unintended upgrades to the public, facilitate bug-tracking, and enable easier management of a changelog.

  - Add ability to modify PID controller parameters while active, held, or paused
  - New method of processing data on live graphs that is more accurate and reduced bandwidth

Features:

  - Add text translation ability (with Spanish as the first translation)
  - New upgrade system to perform upgrades from github releases instead of commits
